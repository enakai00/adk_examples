    "This document provides a technical overview and step-by-step guide for deploying a multi-agent system on **Vertex AI Agent Engine**. It specifically addresses two critical deployment patterns: using **native Agent-to-Agent (A2A) support** for child agents and the **\"deploy from source files\"** method for complex root agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "When building sophisticated AI systems, a single agent often isn't enough. You need a hierarchy where a \"Root Agent\" orchestrates several \"Child Agents.\" This notebook demonstrates how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leverage Native A2A Support:** Deploy individual agents that can communicate via the standardized A2A protocol.\n",
    "2. **Bypass Serialization Limits:** Use the \"source-based deployment\" feature to deploy agents that contain non-serializable objects (like network clients or complex class instances), which would otherwise fail using standard cloudpickle serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of a **Root Agent** (Article Generation Flow) that manages the lifecycle of a request by delegating tasks to specialized **Child Agents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Research Agents (1 & 2):** Handle topic selection and report generation.\n",
    "* **Writer Agent:** Drafts the article based on research.\n",
    "* **Reviewer Agent:** Provides editorial feedback and improvement points.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Deploying A2A-Enabled Child Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The child agents are deployed using the native `A2aAgent` class in `vertexai`. This wraps a standard `LlmAgent` from the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and exposes it via the A2A protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A2aAgentExecutor:** Each child agent uses an executor that wraps its logic to handle A2A-specific communication.\n",
    "* **Session Management:** A custom `MyVertexAiSessionService` is implemented to ensure session persistence across the Vertex AI infrastructure.\n",
    "* **Direct Deployment:** These agents are small enough to be deployed directly using `client.agent_engines.create(agent=a2a_agent, ...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Deploying the Root Agent from Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The Root Agent is more complex. It contains `RemoteA2aAgent` instances and `httpx.AsyncClient` objects which are **not serializable** via standard methods. To solve this, we deploy from source files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Structure the Source Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dedicated directory (e.g., `article_agent/`) containing your logic. The `agent.py` file defines the `AdkApp` entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Define the Entry Point\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing a live object to the deployment function, you define the agent inside the script. The `AdkApp` object acts as the interface for Agent Engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Inside article_agent/agent.py\n",
    "app = AdkApp(\n",
    "    agent=root_agent,\n",
    "    app_name=os.environ.get('GOOGLE_CLOUD_AGENT_ENGINE_ID'),\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Deploy via Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `vertexai.Client`, specify the source package and the module path to the `AdkApp` object. This tells Agent Engine to build the environment from your files rather than serializing your local memory state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "config = {\n",
    "    'display_name': 'article_agent',\n",
    "    'source_packages': ['article_agent'],\n",
    "    'entrypoint_module': 'article_agent.agent',\n",
    "    'entrypoint_object': 'app',\n",
    "    'requirements_file': 'article_agent/requirements.txt',\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "remote_agent = client.agent_engines.create(config=config)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Authentication:** When the Root Agent calls A2A child agents, it requires a refreshable auth token. The provided `GoogleAuthRefresh` class (inheriting from `httpx.Auth`) ensures the agent can always authenticate with Google Cloud APIs.\n",
    "* **Environment Variables:** Agent Engine automatically injects `GOOGLE_CLOUD_AGENT_ENGINE_ID`. Use this as your `app_name` in the `AdkApp` to maintain consistent session mapping.\n",
    "* **Dependency Matching:** Ensure the `requirements.txt` in your source folder exactly matches the versions used during local development to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` during remote execution."

      "#### 1. Digital and Virtual Hanami Experiences\n",
      "\n",
      "The proliferation of digital platforms has opened up new avenues for enjoying hanami, especially for those unable to travel to physical locations. Online livestreams from famous cherry blossom spots across Japan allow viewers worldwide to experience the ephemeral beauty of the blooms in real-time. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are increasingly being utilized to create immersive hanami experiences, offering interactive tours or overlaying digital enhancements onto real-world views. Social media platforms play a significant role, with users sharing photos and videos, participating in themed filters, and engaging with challenges that celebrate the season. Many organizations and tourism boards now offer virtual tours or 360-degree videos, making hanami accessible regardless of geographical barriers or physical limitations. These digital innovations ensure that the spirit of hanami can be shared and celebrated globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Unique Hanami Spots and Alternative Viewing Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond traditional park picnics, hanami is evolving to include more diverse locations and engaging activities. Urban rooftops and observation decks offer unique panoramic views of cherry blossom-filled cityscapes, providing a fresh perspective on the season. Historical sites, such as castles and temples, often feature stunning cherry blossom backdrops, combining cultural exploration with nature appreciation. Alternative viewing activities include boat cruises along rivers lined with cherry trees, allowing for a serene perspective from the water. Cycling tours through blossoming avenues provide an active way to enjoy the scenery, while evening illuminations (yozakura) at various gardens and parks create magical, ethereal experiences with modern light shows and projections. Some locations are also exploring meditation sessions or yoga classes held directly under the blossoming trees, emphasizing mindfulness and connection with nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Hanami Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "As environmental awareness grows, there's a significant push towards more sustainable hanami practices. Organizers and attendees are increasingly focused on responsible waste management, encouraging the use of designated recycling bins and minimizing single-use plastics. Promoting reusable picnic items, such as bento boxes, cutlery, and blankets, helps reduce the ecological footprint of hanami gatherings. Encouraging the use of public transportation or walking to hanami spots helps reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion. Many local businesses participating in hanami events are adopting sustainable sourcing for their food and products, supporting local farmers and eco-conscious suppliers. Educational campaigns are also being implemented to inform visitors about preserving the natural environment, respecting the trees, and keeping public spaces clean for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Themed Events and Artistic Installations\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanami is increasingly becoming a canvas for creative expression, moving beyond simple flower viewing to include curated themed events and artistic installations. Art exhibitions often integrate cherry blossom motifs, sometimes featuring temporary displays that interact with the natural beauty of the blooms. Light festivals, particularly during yozakura events, employ advanced lighting technologies and artistic projections to transform cherry blossom groves into immersive, dreamlike environments. Pop-up events, such as temporary cafes, markets, or craft workshops, are designed around the hanami theme, offering unique cultural and consumer experiences. Cultural performances, including traditional music, dance, or contemporary art installations, are frequently staged under or among cherry blossoms, enhancing the sensory experience. These events aim to provide a more interactive and memorable hanami experience, blending nature with human creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Gourmet and Innovative Hanami Cuisine & Drinks\n",
      "\n",
      "The culinary aspect of hanami is undergoing an exciting evolution, with a surge in gourmet and innovative food and beverage offerings tailored for the season. Beyond traditional picnic fare, chefs are creating sophisticated bento box innovations featuring seasonal ingredients and artistic presentations. Cherry blossom-flavored treats, such as sakura mochi, puddings, chocolates, and even savory dishes, are becoming more diverse and widely available. Artisanal drinks, including sakura-infused teas, craft beers, sakes, and specialty cocktails, are designed to complement the hanami experience. Collaborations between local chefs, food trucks, and established restaurants are leading to unique pop-up dining experiences at hanami venues. Many establishments offer special hanami-themed menus that incorporate spring ingredients and aesthetics, catering to those seeking a refined culinary journey during the blossom viewing season.\n",
